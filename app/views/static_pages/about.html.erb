  <h2 class="article_title">Welcome to BSDSec.net!</h2>
  <p>
    As the title says, this page aims to be <i>deadsimple BSD Security Advisories and Announcements</i>. 
    BSD refers to BSD family of Operating Systems.
    This is a hobby project to learn more about RoR, but I hope BSD sysadmins will find this website handy.
