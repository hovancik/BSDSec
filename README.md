## BSDSec
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/hovancik/BSDSec/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/hovancik/BSDSec)

this is repo for http://www.BSDSec.net, wanna-be <b>deadsimple BSD Security Advisories and Announcements</b>

### Motivation

This app is hobby project to learn more about <i>[RubyOnRails](http://rubyonrails.org/)</i> and do something possibly useful for <i>BSD community</i>. 

Any [criticism](https://github.com/hovancik/BSDSec/issues) very welcome. Please check my blog about BSD at http://DiscoverBSD.com

### Current Status

This app is in very-alfa stage. 

App does receive emails (with [Griddler](https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler) and [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/)), then save it as Article and Tweet about it (with [Twitter](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) gem): 
* FreeBSD 
* OpenBSD
* NetBSD
* MidnightBSD (since Oct'14)
* pfSense (since Oct'14)

DragonflyBSD, PC-BSD doesn't seems to have any announce mailing list or Security Announces (let me know if it change).

App has very simple design, whatever-device friendly. (<b>Any designer here?</b> Would love to get some logo maybe ;] At least for favicon.) 

#### How it works
* As I mentioned, this is a Ruby on Rails app (Rails 4.2.0, ruby 2.1.3p242 (2014-09-19 revision 47630) [x86_64-linux]). 
* I develop on [Koding.com](https://koding.com/R/hovancik). <b>Service is free.</b>
* to be able to use mail, I use [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/)) with [Griddler](https://github.com/thoughtbot/griddler) gem. <b>Thanks Mandrill for free service!</b>
* I subscribe lists with my Gmail address and then make a filter to resend the messages. 
* Other stuff used: [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for icons, [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com) to check it out how it works.  
* Hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) free tier.


So the only money I paid was for Domain, so far.

### TO-DO
* (in prgress) code refactor ;] (anyone?)
* check other BSDs for SA 
* (done - http://reddit.com/r/bsdsec) create reddit /r for discussions (so it would be on reddit, app and tweets would have link to it )
* create command line app (eg.: <tt>bsdec --tag freebsd --time week</tt>) 
* (done) upgrade Griddler to version 1
* make method for adding more tags (like BSDCan, LibreSSL etc. ) as right now it's just freebsd for FreeBSD list etc...
* testing
* (done)  RSS 
* (done) google analytics (when sure with basic funcionality, start pushing master branch only)

## Join! 

Pull Requests are very welcome. 

I do love learning new stuff and I hope this can become community project. I would like to get some RSpec testing on so this all would become much easier. 

Right now BSDSec runs on develop branch (yeah, I know). Might change in future.

## I see ... Errors!
